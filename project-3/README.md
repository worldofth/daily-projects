# project 3
## Purpose
playing around with wireframes, responsive layout and 2 css methodologies.

ITCSS and BEMIT, I think i use these techniques but i've never learnt them from the source, only how other devs code and mention how they use them.

## Outcome

I liked ITCSS and BEMIT, felt like it handled preprocessor css langs better, as it makes room for settings and mixins/functions. felt a little unsure about the folder structure here and there from ITCSS, as i like to keep layouts separate from components though not sure if they are more and less specific than components, went with more for the time being.

I liked playing round with wireframes as it let me more focus on the content and generalise more. I might of gone a little overboard in generalising components, as this wireframe has 2 components and a few different layouts that the components fit into.

I feel like i could of used grid a bit more but i wanted to not deviate too much from the way i normally build and see how it works with flex. I might look at more complicated layouts to test grid out a bit more.
