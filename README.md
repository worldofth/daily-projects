# Daily Dev

a playground to test various ideas and practise during my spare time.

# projects

## project 0
base project to base all future projects on, so i can easily setup a working environment and dive right into programming instead of setting up every time.
This contains:
- mustache templates
- common sass files
- toolchain for js
  - webpack bunderling
  - macha, chai, karma testing

## project 1
a very simple project to more feel out the toolchain i setup for html and css. It is a simple layout found on dribble.

a look into complex animation using just css and playing around with the basic tooling available from chrome dev tools to create the animation.

playing around with the concepts of ITCSS, BEMIT and looking at the new layout techniques available from using both flexbox and grid. The design is based off a wireframe found on dribble.
