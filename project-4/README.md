# project 4

plan to look into functional programming more.
initial project idea is to consume an api, like youtube search and load the content.

Had many issue trying to use new versions of libraries like folktale, also trying to figure out how to use event streams in this setting. I think in more production based coding i will stick to simple functors or maybe just use composition as functor based programming feels too unstable with the current set of available libraries and documentation.

used
- Ramda
- baconjs
- Folktale
