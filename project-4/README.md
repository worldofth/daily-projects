# project 4
## Purpose
I plan to create a simple youtube search app, just getting input from a text field and printing a list of results. The links targeting a iframe to select the video.

## Outcome
Had many issue trying to use new versions of libraries like folktale, also trying to figure out how to use event streams in this setting. I think in more production based coding i will stick to simple functors or maybe just use composition as functor based programming feels too unstable with the current set of available libraries and documentation.

used
- Ramda
- baconjs
- Folktale

I tried many other reactive event streaming libraries but struggled to get them to play ball with folktale functors. I think now that was because i was unsure how to use the folktale libraries more then anything else as the basic interfaces i learnt from online workshops didn't line up. This was mostly due to use the newest version of folktale though.
