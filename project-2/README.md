# project 2

playing around with transition animations, using the animation in kuro nekomonogatari op 48s - 54s.
experimenting with the tools available with chrome dev tools for animation.

I found transitions easier to play with, i felt like i had more control. css animation felt a little more cumbersome because of the lack of control in timing function between different sections of a single keyframe declaration. Also it's kinda annoying how you need to animate a new level of DOM if you want to animation different types of transforms at different rates and timing functions, but makes sense.

will probably come back to this animation to test different animation techniques.
